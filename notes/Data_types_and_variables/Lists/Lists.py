# List is a collection which is index supported and changeable (mutable)
# it allows duplicate members
# they are basis for other abstract daya types like queues(опашки), stacks(купчини)


# creating list
my_list = [1, 2, 'string']

string = "Hello"
string_to_list = list(string)

# using range in list
numbers_list = list(range(11))
# print(numbers_list)

# list may contain duplicate values
one = [1, 1, 1, 1]
